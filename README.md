<h1> amfoss-tasks </h1>

<h2> task-0 </h2>
I installed Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 LTS as per the instructions given in https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-dual-boot-mode-windows/.
Works fine with my laptop though I face a bit of heating issues.

<h2> task-1 </h2>
I did the task as per the resources given in the PDF.

<h2> task-2 </h2>
I googled about it. Did the task using the instructions given in wikiHow.

<h2> task-3 </h2>
Was very challenging. I did 4 of them (Great Eye, Good Strings, The D and Homework Time) but only 2 (Great Eye and The D) got accepted. The other two showed wrong answer/ runtime errors. I couldn't find the reason behind it. I have uploaded the wrong ones too.

<h2> task-4 </h2>
Was very interesting. I used IntelliJ to debug the program. I solved the syntax errors first. It was very easy since the errors were clearly shown in red colour :).
Then I ran the program. Found lots of errors. Since I don't know how the program works (and don't know Java), I tried finding the text displayed as output and made changes accordingly.

<h2> task-5 </h2>
Did not attempt because I could not find any proper tutorials to learn Rust.

<h2> task-6 </h2>
Tried to learn Go Programming Language in YouTube. But I could not solve the task.

<h2> task-7 </h2>
I found Flutter very difficult to learn. The more I googled, the more confused I became.

<h2> task-8 </h2>
The task was very easy, there was not much to do. I found out what Perceval did. When I googled, I found out that there is a python package called pygithub that can be used to access github accounts and repositories. Then I imported the subprocess package to run the program in terminal. There was an error. The code couldn't save it in json file. I couldn't find the answer to it.
One of my mentors, vchrombie, asked me to find alternatives of subprocess module. I found out that the os module does the exact same thing. When I imported it, the program ran sucessfully :) Thank you vchrombie.

<h2> task-9 </h2>
I learnt JavaScript from YouTube videos. Just the basic syntaxes. Then I made the program searching in Google.

<h2> task-10 </h2>
Watched the lectures, but could not solve the problem sets.

<h2> task-11 </h2>
I used canva.com to create the poster. Literally took 10 minutes to finish xD

<h2> task-12 </h2>
Tried to attempt it. But I could not solve it.

<h2> task-13 </h2>
Not a hardware freak tbh.

<h2> task-14 </h2>
I learnt the basic linux commands using YouTube videos. Then I attempted the levels in terminal. Some were really tricky but I got through. I have also uploaded all the steps and commands I used to pass the levels.

<h2> task-15 </h2>
The tasks were pretty straightforward but it was very challenging to make the code more efficient.
I got 3 of them (Even Fibonacci numbers, Multiples of 3 and 5 and Smallest multiple), but only 1 (Even Fibonacci numbers) got accepted. The other two went to timeout errors.
