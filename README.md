#task-0 
I installed Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 LTS as per the instructions given in https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-dual-boot-mode-windows/.
Works fine with my laptop though I face a bit of heating issues.

#task-1
I did the task as per the resources as given in the PDF.

#task-2
I googled about it. Did the task using the instructions given in wikiHow.

#task-3
Was very challenging. I did 4 of them but only 2 got accepted. The other two showed wrong answer and runtime errors. I couldn't find the reason behind it. I have uploaded the wrong ones too.

#task-4
Was very interesting. I used IntelliJ to debug the program. I solved the syntax errors first. It was very easy since the errors were clearly shown in red colour :).
Then I ran the program. Found lots of logical errors. Since I dont know how the program works (and don't know Java), I tried finding the text displayed on the program and made changes accordingly.

#task-8
The task was very easy, there was not much to do. I found out what Perceval did. When I googled, I found out that there is a python package called pygithub that can be used to access github accounts and repositories. Then I imported the subprocess package to run the program in terminal. There was an error. It couldn't save it in json file. I couldn't find the answer to it.
One of my mentors, vchrombie, asked me to find alternatives of subprocess module. I found out that the os module does the exact same thing. When I did it, the program ran sucessfully. :) Thank you vchrombie

#task-9
I learnt JavaScript from YouTube videos. Just the basic syntaxes. Then I made the program using frequent searches in Google.

#task-11
I used canva.com to create the poster.

#task-14
I learnt the basic linux commands using YouTube videos. Then I attempted the levels in terminal. Some were really tricky but I got through. I have also uploaded all the steps and commands I used to pass the levels.

#task-15
The tasks were pretty straightforward. Simple too. But it was very challenging to make the code more efficient.
I got 3 of them, but only 1 got accepted. The other two went to timeout errors.
