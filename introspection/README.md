1. Why must we choose you? 
My goal is to become a software engineer. For that to happen, I am willing and determined to anything which will lead me to its path.

2. What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I plan to expand my knowledge in programming by practising my competitive programming skills and become closer to reach my goal.

3.How would you contribute back to the club?
After I join the club, I will take part in all the activities that take part in the club. I am willing to help anyone who need a helping hand in the club. I will also try to do summer projects too.

4. Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
I don't have any feedback for the selection process. The mentors were very friendly. I could speak to them freely. If I had a doubt, they would respond instantly.
Regarding the tasks, they were perfect for anyone who are experienced and inexperienced in programming. The tasks are selected in such a way that a person with no experience in programming can attempt atleast 2-3 tasks. Also the wide variey of the topics in the tasks makes it even more challenging to attempt.
