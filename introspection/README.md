1. My goal is to become a software engineer. For that to happen, I am willing and determined to anything which will lead me to its path.

2. I plan to expand my knowledge in programming by practising my competitive programming skills and become one step closer to reach my goal.

3. After I join the club, I will take part in all the activities that take part in the club. I am willing to help anyone who need a helping hand in the club. I will also try to do summer projects too.

4. I don't have any feedback for the selection process. Its perfect for anyone who are experienced and inexperienced in programming. The tasks are selected in such a way that a person with no experience can attempt atleast 2-3 tasks. Also the wide variey of the topics in the tasks makes it even more challenging to attempt.
